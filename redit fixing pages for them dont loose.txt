## Notation techniques

* [Vocabulary](https://www.reddit.com/r/sudoku/about/wiki/index/vocabulary/)

When notating a puzzle, it's often very helpful to mark candidates positionally, like on a phone keypad (AKA):  

    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9

In a cell, either with small numbers or dots, that way it gets easier to see patterns in the puzzle without having to read each cell.
